      Preface by Robert Leslie Ellis
    </h2>
<p>
      The following fragments of a great work on the Interpretation of Nature
      were first published in Stephens's Letters and Remains [1734]
      They consist partly of detached passages, and partly of an epitome of
      twelve chapters of the first book of the proposed work. The detached
      passages contain the first, sixth, and eighth chapters, and portions of
      the fourth, fifth, seventh, ninth, tenth, eleventh, and sixteenth. The
      epitome contains an account of the contents of all the chapters from the
      twelfth to the twenty-sixth inclusive, omitting the twentieth,
      twentythird, and twenty-fourth. Thus the sixteenth chapter is mentioned
      both in the epitome and among the detached passages, and we are thus
      enabled to see that the two portions of the following tract belong to the
      same work, as it appears from both that the sixteenth chapter was to treat
      of the doctrine of idola.
    </p>
<p>
      It is impossible to ascertain the motive which determined Bacon to give to
      the supposed author the name of Valerius Terminus, or to his commentator,
      of whose annotations we have no remains, that of Hermes Stella. It may be
      conjectured that by the name Terminus he intended to intimate that the new
      philosophy would put an end to the wandering of mankind in search of
      truth, that it would be the TERMINUS AD QUEM in which when it was once
      attained the mind would finally acquiesce.
    </p>
<p>
      Again, the obscurity of the text was to be in some measure removed by the
      annotations of Stella; not however wholly, for Bacon in the epitome of the
      eighteenth chapter commends the manner of publishing knowledge "whereby it
      shall not be to the capacity nor taste of all, but shall as it were single
      and adopt his reader." Stella was therefore to throw a kind of starlight
      on the subject, enough to prevent the student's losing his way, but not
      much more.
    </p>
<p>
      However this may be, the tract is undoubtedly obscure, partly from the
      style in which it is written, and partly from its being only a fragment.
      It is at the same time full of interest, inasmuch as it is the earliest
      type of the INSTAURATIO...
    </p>
<p>
      Note to Preface by James Spedding:
    </p>
<p>
      The manuscript from which Robert Stephens printed these fragments was
      found among some loose papers placed in his hands by the Earl of Oxford,
      and is now in the British Museum; Harl. manuscripts 6462. It is a thin
      paper volume of the quarto size, written in the hand of one of Bacon's
      servants, with corrections, erasures, and interlineations in his own.
    </p>
<p>
      The chapters of which it consists are both imperfect in themselves (all
      but three),—some breaking off abruptly, others being little more
      than tables of contents,—and imperfect in their connexion with each
      other; so much so as to suggest the idea of a number of separate papers
      loosely put together. But it was not so (and the fact is important) that
      the volume itself was actually made up. However they came together, they
      are here fairly and consecutively copied out. Though it be a collection of
      fragments therefore, it is such a collection as Bacon thought worthy not
      only of being preserved, but of being transcribed into a volume; and a
      particular account of it will not be out of place.
    </p>
<p>
      The contents of the manuscript before Bacon touched it may be thus
      described.
    </p>
<p>
      1. A titlepage, on which is written "VALERIUS TERMINUS of the
      Interpretation of Nature, with the annotations of HERMES STELLA."
    </p>
<p>
      2. "Chapter I. Of the limits and end of knowledge;" with a running title,
      "Of the Interpretation of Nature."
    </p>
<p>
      3. "The chapter immediately following the Inventory; being the 11th in
      order."
    </p>
<p>
      4. "A part of the 9th chapter, immediately precedent to the Inventory, and
      inducing the same."
    </p>
<p>
      5. "The Inventory, or an enumeration and view of inventions already
      discovered and in use, together with a note of the wants and the nature of
      the supplies; being the 10th chapter, and this a fragment only of the
      same."
    </p>
<p>
      6. Part of a chapter, not numbered, "Of the internal and profound errors
      and superstitions in the nature of the mind, and of the four sorts of
      Idols or fictions which offer themselves to the understanding in the
      inquisition of knowledge."
    </p>
<p>
      7. "Of the impediments of knowledge; being the third chapter, the preface
      only of it."
    </p>
<p>
      8. "Of the impediments which have been in the times and in diversion of
      wits; being the fourth chapter."
    </p>
<p>
      9. "Of the impediments of knowledge for want of a true succession of wits,
      and that hitherto the length of one man's life hath been the greatest
      measure of knowledge; being the fifth chapter."
    </p>
<p>
      10. "That the pretended succession of wits hath been evil placed,
      forasmuch as after variety of sects and opinions the most popular and not
      the truest prevaileth and weareth out the rest; being the sixth chapter."
    </p>
<p>
      11. "Of the impediments of knowledge in handling it by parts, and in
      slipping off particular sciences from the root and stock of universal
      knowledge; being the seventh chapter."
    </p>
<p>
      12. "That the end and scope of knowledge hath been generally mistaken, and
      that men were never well advised what it was they sought" (part of a
      chapter not numbered).
    </p>
<p>
      13. "An abridgment of divers chapters of the first book;" namely, the
      l2th, 13th, and 14th, (over which is a running title "Of active
      knowledge;") and (without any running title) the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th],
      19th, 21st, 22nd, 25th, and 26th. These abridgments have no headings; and
      at the end is written, "The end of the Abridgment of the first book of the
      Interpretation of Nature."
    </p>
<p>
      Such was the arrangement of the manuscript as the transcriber left it;
      which I have thought worth preserving, because I seem to see traces in it
      of two separate stages in the developement of the work; the order of the
      chapters as they are transcribed being probably the same in which Bacon
      wrote them; and the numbers inserted at the end of the headings indicating
      the order in which, when he placed them in the transcriber's hands, it was
      his intention to arrange them; and because it proves at any rate that at
      that time the design of the whole book was clearly laid out in his mind.
    </p>
<p>
      There is nothing, unfortunately, to fix the DATE of the transcript, unless
      it be implied in certain astronomical or astrological symbols written on
      the blank outside of the volume; in which the figures 1603 occur. This may
      possibly be the transcriber's note of the time when he finished his work;
      for which (but for one circumstance which I shall mention presently) I
      should think the year 1603 is likely a date as any; for we know from a
      letter of Bacon's, dated 3rd July 1603, that he had at that time resolved
      "to meddle as little as possible in the King's causes," and to "put his
      ambition wholly upon his pen;" and we know from the ADVANCEMENT OF
      LEARNING that in 1605 he was engaged upon a work entitled "The
      Interpretation of Nature:" to which I may add that there is in the Lambeth
      Library a copy of a letter from Bacon to Lord Kinlosse, dated 25th March,
      1603, and written in the same hand as this manuscript.
    </p>
<p>
      Bacon's corrections, if I may judge from the character of the handwriting,
      were inserted a little later; for it is a fact that about the beginning of
      James's reign his writing underwent a remarkable change, from the hurried
      Saxon hand full of large sweeping curves and with letters imperfectly
      formed and connected, which he wrote in Elizabeth's time, to a small,
      neat, light, and compact one, formed more upon the Italian model which was
      then coming into fashion; and when these corrections were made it is
      evident that this new character had become natural to him and easy. It is
      of course impossible to fix the precise date of such a change,—the
      more so because his autographs of this period are very scarce,—but
      whenever it was that he corrected this manuscript, it is evident that he
      then considered it worthy of careful revision. He has not merely inserted
      a sentence here and there, altered the numbers of the chapters, and added
      words to the headings in order to make the description more exact; but he
      has taken the trouble to add the running title wherever it was wanting,
      thus writing the words "of the Interpretation of Nature" at full lengths
      not less than eighteen times over; and upon the blank space of the
      titlepage he has written out a complete table of contents. In short, if he
      had been preparing the manuscript for the press or for a fresh transcript,
      he could not have done it more completely or carefully,—only that he
      has given no directions for altering the order of the chapters so as to
      make it correspond with the numbers. And hence I infer that up to the time
      when he made these corrections, this was the form of the great work on
      which he was engaged: it was a work concerning the Interpretation of
      Nature; which was to begin where the NOVUM ORGANUM begins; and of which
      the first book was to include all the preliminary considerations
      preparatory to the exposition of the formula.
    </p>
<p>
      I place this fragment here in deference to Mr. Ellis's decided opinion
      that it was written before the ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING. The positive
      ground indeed which he alleges in support of that conclusion I am obliged
      to set aside, as founded, I think, upon a misapprehension; and the
      supposition that no part of it was written later involves a difficulty
      which I cannot yet get over to my own satisfaction. But that the body of
      it was written earlier I see no reason to doubt; and if so, this is its
      proper place.
    </p>
<p>
      The particular point on which I venture to disagree with Mr. Ellis I have
      stated in a note upon his preface to the NOVUM ORGANUM, promising at the
      same time a fuller explanation of the grounds of my own conclusion, which
      I will now give.
    </p>
<p>
      The question is, whether the "Inventory" in the 10th chapter of VALERIUS
      TERMINUS was to have exhibited a general survey of the state of knowledge
      corresponding with that which fills the second book of the ADVANCEMENT OF
      LEARNING. I think not.
    </p>
<p>
      It is true indeed that the title of that 10th chapter,—namely, "The
      Inventory, or an enumeration and view of inventions already discovered and
      in use, with a note of the wants and the nature of the supplies",—has
      at first sight a considerable resemblance to the description of the
      contents of the second book of the ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING,—namely,
      "A general and faithful perambulation of learning, with an inquiry what
      parts thereof lie fresh and waste, and not improved and converted by the
      industry of Man;... wherein nevertheless my purpose is at this time to
      note only omissions and deficiencies, and not to make any redargutions of
      errors," and so on. But an "enumeration of INVENTIONS" is not the same
      thing as "a perambulation of LEARNING;" and it will be found upon closer
      examination that the "Inventory" spoken of in VALERIUS TERMINUS does
      really correspond to one, and one only, of the fiftyone Desiderata set
      down at the end of the DE AUGMENTIS; viz. that INVENTARIUM OPUM HUMANARUM,
      which was to be an appendix to the MAGIA NATURALIS. See DE AUG. iii. 5.
      This will appear clearly by comparing the descriptions of the two.
    </p>
<p>
      In the ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING Bacon tells us that there are two points of
      much purpose pertaining to the department of Natural Magic: the first of
      which is, "That there be made a calendar resembling an Inventory of the
      ESTATE OF MAN, containing ALL THE INVENTIONS, BEING THE WORKS OR FRUITS OF
      NATURE OR ART, which are now extant AND OF WHICH MAN IS ALREADY POSSESSED;
      out of which doth naturally result a note what things are yet held
      impossible or not invented; which calendar will be the more artificial and
      serviceable if to every reputed impossibility you add what thing is extant
      which cometh the nearest in degree to that impossibility: to the end that
      by these optatives and essentials man's inquiry may be the more awake in
      deducing direction of works from the speculation of causes."
    </p>
<p>
      The Inventory which was to have been inserted in the 10th chapter of
      VALERIUS TERMINUS is thus introduced:—"The plainest method and most
      directly pertinent to this intention will be to make distribution of
      SCIENCES, ARTS, INVENTIONS, WORKS, and their portions, ACCORDING TO THE
      USE AND TRIBUTE WHICH THEY YIELD AND RENDER TO THE CONDITION OF MAN'S
      LIFE; and under those several uses, being as several offices of
      provisions, to charge and tax what may be reasonably exacted or
      demanded,... and then upon those charges and taxations to distinguish and
      present as it were in several columns what is extant and already found,
      and what is DEFECTIVE AND FURTHER TO BE PROVIDED. Of which provisions
      because in many of them, after the manner of slothful and faulty
      accomptants, it will be returned by way of excuse that no such are to be
      had, it will be fit to give some light OF THE NATURE OF THE SUPPLIES;
      whereby it will evidently appear that they are to be compassed and
      procured." And that the calendar was to deal, not with knowledge in
      general, but only with arts and sciences of invention in its more
      restricted sense—the PARS OPERATIVA DE NATURA (DE AUG. iii. 5.)—appears
      no less clearly from the opening of the 11th chapter, which was designed
      immediately to follow the "Inventory." "It appeareth then what is now in
      proposition, not by general circumlocution but by particular note. No
      former philosophy," etc. etc. "but the revealing and discovering of NEW
      INVENTIONS AND OPERATIONS,... the nature and kinds of which inventions
      HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED as they could be discovered," etc. If further evidence
      were required of the exact resemblance between the Inventory of VALERIUS
      TERMINUS and the Inventarium of the ADVANCEMENT and the DE AUGMENTIS, I
      might quote the end of the 9th chapter, where the particular expressions
      correspond, if possible, more closely still. But I presume that the
      passages which I have given are enough; and that the opinion which I have
      elsewhere expressed as to the origin of the ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING,—namely,
      that the writing of it was a by-thought and no part of the work on the
      Interpretation of Nature as originally designed,—will not be
      considered inconsistent with the evidence afforded by these fragments.
    </p>
<p>
      That the VALERIUS TERMINUS was composed before the ADVANCEMENT, though a
      conclusion not deducible from the Inventory, is nevertheless probable: but
      to suppose that it was so composed EXACTLY IN ITS PRESENT FORM, involves,
      as I said, a difficulty; which I will now state. The point is interesting,
      as bearing directly upon the developement in Bacon's mind of the doctrine
      of Idols; concerning which see preface to NOVUM ORGANUM, note C. But I
      have to deal with it here merely as bearing upon the probable date of this
      fragment.
    </p>
<p>
      In treating of the department of Logic in the ADVANCEMENT, Bacon notices
      as altogether wanting "the particular elenches or cautions against three
      false appearances" or fallacies by which the mind of man is beset: the
      "caution" of which, he says, "doth extremely import the true conduct of
      human judgment." These false appearances he describes, though he does not
      give their names; and they correspond respectively to what he afterwards
      called the Idols of the Tribe, the Cave, and the Forum. But he makes no
      mention of the fourth; namely, the Idols of the Theatre. Now in VALERIUS
      TERMINUS we find two separate passages in which the Idols are mentioned;
      and in both all four are enumerated, and all by name; though what he
      afterwards called Idols of the Forum, he there calls Idols of the Palace;
      and it seems to me very unlikely that, if when he wrote the ADVANCEMENT he
      had already formed that classification he should have omitted all mention
      of the Idols of the Theatre; for though it is true that that was not the
      place to discuss them, and therefore in the corresponding passage of the
      DE AUGMENTIS they are noticed as to be passed by "for the present," yet
      they are noticed by name, and in all Bacon's later writings the
      confutation of them holds a very prominent place.
    </p>
<p>
      To me the most probable explanation of the fact is this. I have already
      shown that between the composition and the transcription of these
      fragments the design of the work appears to have undergone a considerable
      change; the order of the chapters being entirely altered. We have only to
      suppose therefore that they were composed before the ADVANCEMENT and
      transcribed after, and that in preparing them for the transcriber Bacon
      made the same kind of alterations in the originals which he afterwards
      made upon the transcript, and the difficulty disappears. Nothing would be
      easier than to correct "three" into "four," and insert "the Idols of the
      Theatre" at the end of the sentence.
    </p>
<p>
      And this reminds me (since I shall have so much to do with these questions
      of date) to suggest a general caution with regard to them all; namely,
      that in the case of fragments like these, the comparison of isolated
      passages can hardly ever be relied upon for evidence of the date or order
      of composition, or of the progressive developement of the writer's views;
      and for this simple reason,—we can never be sure that the passages
      as they now stand formed part of the original writing. The copy of the
      fragment which we have may be (as there is reason to believe this was) a
      transcript from several loose papers, written at different periods and
      containing alterations or additions made from time to time. We may know
      perhaps that when Bacon published the ADVANCEMCNT OF LEARNING he was
      ignorant of some fact with which he afterwards became acquainted; we may
      find in one of these fragments,—say the TEMPORIS PARTUS MASCULUS,—a
      passage implying acquaintance with that fact. Does it follow that the
      TEMPORIS PARTUS MASCULUS was written after the ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING?
      No; for in looking over the manuscript long after it was written, he may
      have observed and corrected the error. And we cannot conclude that he at
      the same time altered the whole composition so as to bring it into
      accordance with the views he then held; for that might be too long a work.
      He may have inserted a particular correction, but meant to rewrite the
      whole; and if so, in spite of the later date indicated by that particular
      passage, the body of the work would still represent a stage in his
      opinions anterior to the ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING.
    </p>
<p>
      I have felt some doubt whether in printing this fragment, I should follow
      the example of Stephens, who gave it exactly as he found it; or that of
      later editors, who have altered the order of the chapters so as to make it
      agree with the numbers. The latter plan will perhaps, upon the whole, be
      the more convenient. There can he little doubt that the numbers of the
      chapters indicate the order in which Bacon meant them to be read; and if
      any one wishes to compare it with the order in which they seem to have
      been written, he has only to look at Bacon's table of contents, which was
      made with reference to the transcript, and which I give unaltered, except
      as to the spelling.

      CHAPTER 1. — OF THE LIMITS AND END OF KNOWLEDGE.
    </h2>
<p>
      In the divine nature both religion and philosophy hath acknowledged
      goodness in perfection, science or providence comprehending all things,
      and absolute sovereignty or kingdom. In aspiring to the throne of power
      the angels transgressed and fell, in presuming to come within the oracle
      of knowledge man transgressed and fell; but in pursuit towards the
      similitude of God's goodness or love (which is one thing, for love is
      nothing else but goodness put in motion or applied) neither man or spirit
      ever hath transgressed, or shall transgress.
    </p>
<p>
      The angel of light that was, when he presumed before his fall, said within
      himself, I WILL ASCEND AND BE LIKE UNTO THE HIGHEST; not God, but the
      highest. To be like to God in goodness, was no part of his emulation;
      knowledge, being in creation an angel of light, was not the want which did
      most solicit him; only because he was a minister he aimed at a supremacy;
      therefore his climbing or ascension was turned into a throwing down or
      precipitation.
    </p>
<p>
      Man on the other side, when he was tempted before he fell, had offered
      unto him this suggestion, THAT HE SHOULD BE LIKE UNTO GOD. But how? Not
      simply, but in this part, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL. For being in his creation
      invested with sovereignty of all inferior creatures, he was not needy of
      power or dominion; but again, being a spirit newly inclosed in a body of
      earth, he was fittest to be allured with appetite of light and liberty of
      knowledge; therefore this approaching and intruding into God's secrets and
      mysteries was rewarded with a further removing and estranging from God's
      presence. But as to the goodness of God, there is no danger in contending
      or advancing towards a similitude thereof, as that which is open and
      propounded to our imitation. For that voice (whereof the heathen and all
      other errors of religion have ever confessed that it sounds not like man),
      LOVE YOUR ENEMIES; BE YOU LIKE UNTO YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER, THAT SUFFERETH
      HIS RAIN TO FALL BOTH UPON THE JUST AND THE UNJUST, doth well declare,
      that we can in that point commit no excess; so again we find it often
      repeated in the old law, BE YOU HOLY AS I AM HOLY; and what is holiness
      else but goodness, as we consider it separate and guarded from all mixture
      and all access of evil?
    </p>
<p>
      Wherefore seeing that knowledge is of the number of those things which are
      to be accepted of with caution and distinction; being now to open a
      fountain, such as it is not easy to discern where the issues and streams
      thereof will take and fall; I thought it good and necessary in the first
      place to make a strong and sound head or bank to rule and guide the course
      of the waters; by setting down this position or firmament, namely, THAT
      ALL KNOWLEDGE IS TO BE LIMITED BY RELIGION, AND TO BE REFERRED TO USE AND
      ACTION.
    </p>
<p>
      For if any man shall think by view and inquiry into these sensible and
      material things, to attain to any light for the revealing of the nature or
      will of God, he shall dangerously abuse himself. It is true that the
      contemplation of the creatures of God hath for end (as to the natures of
      the creatures themselves) knowledge, but as to the nature of God, no
      knowledge, but wonder; which is nothing else but contemplation broken off;
      or losing itself. Nay further, as it was aptly said by one of Plato's
      school THE SENSE OF MAN RESEMBLES THE SUN, WHICH OPENETH AND REVEALETH THE
      TERRESTRIAL GLOBE, BUT OBSCURETH AND CONCEALETH THE CELESTIAL; so doth the
      sense discover natural things, but darken and shut up divine. And this
      appeareth sufficiently in that there is no proceeding in invention of
      knowledge but by similitude; and God is only self-like, having nothing in
      common with any creature, otherwise than as in shadow and trope. Therefore
      attend his will as himself openeth it, and give unto faith that which unto
      faith belongeth; for more worthy it is to believe than to think or know,
      considering that in knowledge (as we now are capable of it) the mind
      suffereth from inferior natures; but in all belief it suffereth from a
      spirit which it holdeth superior and more authorised than itself.
    </p>
<p>
      To conclude, the prejudice hath been infinite that both divine and human
      knowledge hath received by the intermingling and tempering of the one with
      the other; as that which hath filled the one full of heresies, and the
      other full of speculative fictions and vanities.
    </p>
<p>
      But now there are again which in a contrary extremity to those which give
      to contemplation an overlarge scope, do offer too great a restraint to
      natural and lawful knowledge, being unjustly jealous that every reach and
      depth of knowledge wherewith their conceits have not been acquainted,
      should be too high an elevation of man's wit, and a searching and
      ravelling too far into God's secrets; an opinion that ariseth either of
      envy (which is proud weakness and to be censured and not confuted), or
      else of a deceitful simplicity. For if they mean that the ignorance of a
      second cause doth make men more devoutly to depend upon the providence of
      God, as supposing the effects to come immediately from his hand, I demand
      of them, as Job demanded of his friends, WILL YOU LIE FOR GOD AS MAN WILL
      FOR MAN TO GRATIFY HIM? But if any man without any sinister humour doth
      indeed make doubt that this digging further and further into the mine of
      natural knowledge is a thing without example and uncommended in the
      Scriptures, or fruitless; let him remember and be instructed; for behold
      it was not that pure light of natural knowledge, whereby man in paradise
      was able to give unto every living creature a name according to his
      propriety, which gave occasion to the fall; but it was an aspiring desire
      to attain to that part of moral knowledge which defineth of good and evil,
      whereby to dispute God's commandments and not to depend upon the
      revelation of his will, which was the original temptation. And the first
      holy records, which within those brief memorials of things which passed
      before the flood entered few things as worthy to be registered but only
      lineages and propagations, yet nevertheless honour the remembrance of the
      inventor both of music and works in metal. Moses again (who was the
      reporter) is said to have been seen in all the Egyptian learning, which
      nation was early and leading in matter of knowledge. And Salomon the king,
      as out of a branch of his wisdom extraordinarily petitioned and granted
      from God, is said to have written a natural history of all that is green
      from the cedar to the moss, (which is but a rudiment between putrefaction
      and an herb,) and also of all that liveth and moveth. And if the book of
      Job be turned over, it will be found to have much aspersion of natural
      philosophy. Nay, the same Salomon the king affirmeth directly that the
      glory of God IS TO CONCEAL A THING, BUT THE GLORY OF THE KING IS TO FIND
      IT OUT, as if according to the innocent play of children the divine
      Majesty took delight to hide his works, to the end to have them found out;
      for in naming the king he intendeth man, taking such a condition of man as
      hath most excellency and greatest commandment of wits and means, alluding
      also to his own person, being truly one of those clearest burning lamps,
      whereof himself speaketh in another place, when he saith THE SPIRIT OF MAN
      IS AS THE LAMB, OF GOD, WHEREWITH HE SEARCHETH ALL INWARDNESS; which
      nature of the soul the same Salomon holding precious and inestimable, and
      therein conspiring with the affection of Socrates who scorned the
      pretended learned men of his time for raising great benefit of their
      learning (whereas Anaxagoras contrariwise and divers others being born to
      ample patrimonies decayed them in contemplation), delivereth it in precept
      yet remaining, BUY THE TRUTH, AND SELL IT NOT; AND SO OF WISDOM AND
      KNOWLEDGE.
    </p>
<p>
      And lest any man should retain a scruple as if this thirst of knowledge
      were rather an humour of the mind than an emptiness or want in nature and
      an instinct from God, the same author defineth of it fully, saying, GOD
      HATH MADE EVERY THING IN BEAUTY ACCORDING TO SEASON; ALSO HE HATH SET THE
      WORLD IN MAN'S HEART, YET CAN HE NOT FIND OUT THE WORK WHICH GOD WORKETH
      FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END: declaring not obscurely that God hath
      framed the mind of man as a glass capable of the image of the universal
      world, joying to receive the signature thereof as the eye is of light, yea
      not only satisfied in beholding the variety of things and vicissitude of
      times, but raised also to find out and discern those ordinances and
      decrees which throughout all these changes are infallibly observed. And
      although the highest generality of motion or summary law of nature God
      should still reserve within his own curtain, yet many and noble are the
      inferior and secondary operations which are within man's sounding. This is
      a thing which I cannot tell whether I may so plainly speak as truly
      conceive, that as all knowledge appeareth to be a plant of God's own
      planting, so it may seem the spreading and flourishing or at least the
      bearing and fructifying of this plant, by a providence of God, nay not
      only by a general providence but by a special prophecy, was appointed to
      this autumn of the world: for to my understanding it is not violent to the
      letter, and safe now after the event, so to interpret that place in the
      prophecy of Daniel where speaking of the latter times it is said, MANY
      SHALL PASS TO AND FRO, AND SCIENCE SHALL BE INCREASED; as if the opening
      of the world by navigation and commerce and the further discovery of
      knowledge should meet in one time or age.
    </p>
<p>
      But howsoever that be, there are besides the authorities of Scriptures
      before recited, two reasons of exceeding great weight and force why
      religion should dearly protect all increase of natural knowledge: the one,
      because it leadeth to the greater exaltation of the glory of God; for as
      the Psalms and other Scriptures do often invite us to consider and to
      magnify the great and wonderful works of God, so if we should rest only in
      the contemplation of those shews which first offer themselves to our
      senses, we should do a like injury to the majesty of God, as if we should
      judge of the store of some excellent jeweler by that only which is set out
      to the street in his shop. The other reason is, because it is a singular
      help and a preservative against unbelief and error; for, saith our
      Saviour, YOU ERR, NOT KNOWING THE SCRIPTURES NOR THE POWER OF GOD; laying
      before us two books or volumes to study if we will be secured from error;
      first the Scriptures revealing the will of God, and then the creatures
      expressing his power; for that latter book will certify us that nothing
      which the first teacheth shall be thought impossible. And most sure it is,
      and a true conclusion of experience, that a little natural philosophy
      inclineth the mind to atheism, but a further proceeding bringeth the mind
      back to religion.
    </p>
<p>
      To conclude then, let no man presume to check the liberality of God's
      gifts, who, as was said, HATH SET THE WORLD IN MAN'S HEART. So as
      whatsoever is not God but parcel of the world, he hath fitted it to the
      comprehension of man's mind, if man will open and dilate the powers of his
      understanding as he may.
    </p>
<p>
      But yet evermore it must be remembered that the least part of knowledge
      passed to man by this so large a charter from God must be subject to that
      use for which God hath granted it; which is the benefit and relief of the
      state and society of man; for otherwise all manner of knowledge becometh
      malign and serpentine, and therefore as carrying the quality of the
      serpent's sting and malice it maketh the mind of man to swell; as the
      Scripture saith excellently, knowledge bloweth up, but charity buildeth
      up. And again the same author doth notably disavow both power and
      knowledge such as is not dedicated to goodness or love, for saith he, IF I
      HAVE ALL FAITH SO AS I COULD REMOVE MOUNTAINS, (there is power active,) IF
      I RENDER MY BODY TO THE FIRE, (there is power passive,) IF I SPEAK WITH
      THE TONGUES OF MEN AND ANGELS, (there is knowledge, for language is but
      the conveyance of knowledge,) ALL WERE NOTHING.
    </p>
<p>
      And therefore it is not the pleasure of curiosity, nor the quiet of
      resolution, nor the raising of the spirit, nor victory of wit, nor faculty
      of speech, nor lucre of profession, nor ambition of honour or fame, nor
      inablement for business, that are the true ends of knowledge; some of
      these being more worthy than other, though all inferior and degenerate:
      but it is a restitution and reinvesting (in great part) of man to the
      sovereignty and power (for whensoever he shall be able to call the
      creatures by their true names he shall again command them) which he had in
      his first state of creation. And to speak plainly and clearly, it is a
      discovery of all operations and possibilities of operations from
      immortality (if it were possible) to the meanest mechanical practice. And
      therefore knowledge that tendeth but to satisfaction is but as a
      courtesan, which is for pleasure and not for fruit or generation. And
      knowledge that tendeth to profit or profession or glory is but as the
      golden ball thrown before Atalanta, which while she goeth aside and
      stoopeth to take up she hindereth the race. And knowledge referred to some
      particular point of use is but as Harmodius which putteth down one tyrant,
      and not like Hercules who did perambulate the world to suppress tyrants
      and giants and monsters in every part. It is true, that in two points the
      curse is peremptory and not to be removed; the one that vanity must be the
      end in all human effects, eternity being resumed, though the revolutions
      and periods may be delayed. The other that the consent of the creature
      being now turned into reluctation, this power cannot otherwise be
      exercised and administered but with labour, as well in inventing as in
      executing; yet nevertheless chiefly that labour and travel which is
      described by the sweat of the brows more than of the body; that is such
      travel as is joined with the working and discursion of the spirits in the
      brain: for as Salomon saith excellently, THE FOOL PUTTETH TO MORE
      STRENGTH, BUT THE WISE MAN CONSIDERETH WHICH WAY, signifying the election
      of the mean to be more material than the multiplication of endeavour. It
      is true also that there is a limitation rather potential than actual,
      which is when the effect is possible, but the time or place yieldeth not
      the matter or basis whereupon man should work. But notwithstanding these
      precincts and bounds, let it be believed, and appeal thereof made to Time,
      (with renunciation nevertheless to all the vain and abusing promises of
      Alchemists and Magicians, and such like light, idle, ignorant, credulous,
      and fantastical wits and sects,) that the new-found world of land was not
      greater addition to the ancient continent than there remaineth at this day
      a world of inventions and sciences unknown, having respect to those that
      are known, with this difference that the ancient regions of knowledge will
      seem as barbarous compared with the new, as the new regions of people seem
      barbarous compared to many of the old.
    </p>
<p>
      The dignity of this end (of endowment of man's life with new commodities)
      appeareth by the estimation that antiquity made of such as guided
      thereunto. For whereas founders of states, lawgivers, extirpers of
      tyrants, fathers of the people, were honoured but with the titles of
      Worthies or Demigods, inventors were ever consecrated amongst the Gods
      themselves. And if the ordinary ambitions of men lead them to seek the
      amplification of their own power in their countries, and a better ambition
      than that hath moved men to seek the amplification of the power of their
      own countries amongst other nations, better again and more worthy must
      that aspiring be which seeketh the amplification of the power and kingdom
      of mankind over the world; the rather because the other two prosecutions
      are ever culpable of much perturbation and injustice; but this is a work
      truly divine, which cometh IN AURA LENI without noise or observation.
    </p>
<p>
      The access also to this work hath been by that port or passage, which the
      divine Majesty (who is unchangeabIe in his ways) doth infallibly continue
      and observe; that is the felicity wherewith he hath blessed an humility of
      mind, such as rather laboureth to spell and so by degrees to read in the
      volumes of his creatures, than to solicit and urge and as it were to
      invocate a man's own spirit to divine and give oracles unto him. For as in
      the inquiry of divine truth, the pride of man hath ever inclined to leave
      the oracles of God's word and to vanish in the mixture of their own
      inventions; so in the self-same manner, in inquisition of nature they have
      ever left the oracles of God's works, and adored the deceiving and
      deformed imagery which the unequal mirrors of their own minds have
      represented unto them. Nay it is a point fit and necessary in the front
      and beginning of this work without hesitation or reservation to be
      professed, that it is no less true in this human kingdom of knowledge than
      in God's kingdom of heaven, that no man shall enter into it EXCEPT HE
      BECOME FIRST AS A LITTLE CHILD.

      CHAPTER 4.
    </h2>
<p>
      OF THE IMPEDIMENTS OF KNOWLEDGE, BEING THE 4TH CHAPTER, THE PREFACE ONLY
      OF IT.
    </p>
<p>
      In some things it is more hard to attempt than to achieve, which falleth
      out when the difficulty is not so much in the matter or subject, as it is
      in the crossness and indisposition of the mind of man to think of any such
      thing, to will or to resolve it. And therefore Titus Livius in his
      declamatory digression wherein he doth depress and extenuate the honour of
      Alexander's conquests saith, NIHIL ALIUD QUAM BENE AUSUS VANA CONTEMNERE:
      in which sort of things it is the manner of men first to wonder that any
      such thing should be possible, and after it is found out to wonder again
      how the world should miss it so long. Of this nature I take to be the
      invention and discovery of knowledge, etc.
    </p>
<p>
      THE IMPEDIMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN IN THE TIMES, AND IN DIVERSION OF WITS,
      BEING THE 5TH CHAPTER, A SMALL FRAGMENT IN THE BEGINNING OF THAT CHAPTER.
    </p>
<p>
      The encounters of the times have been nothing favourable and prosperous
      for the invention of knowledge; so as it is not only the daintiness of the
      seed to take, and the ill mixture and unliking of the ground to nourish or
      raise this plant, but the ill season also of the weather by which it hath
      been checked and blasted. Especially in that the seasons have been proper
      to bring up and set forward other more hasty and indifferent plants,
      whereby this of knowledge bath been starved and overgrown; for in the
      descent of times always there hath been somewhat else in reign and
      reputation, which hath generally aliened and diverted wits and labours
      from that employment.
    </p>
<p>
      For as for the uttermost antiquity which is like fame that muffles her
      head and tells tales, I cannot presume much of it; for I would not
      willingly imitate the manner of those that describe maps, which when they
      come to some far countries whereof they have no knowledge, set down how
      there be great wastes and deserts there: so I am not apt to affirm that
      they knew little, because what they knew is little known to us. But if you
      will judge of them by the last traces that remain to us, you will
      conclude, though not so scornfully as Aristotle doth, that saith our
      ancestors were extreme gross, as those that came newly from being moulded
      out of the clay or some earthly substance; yet reasonably and probably
      thus, that it was with them in matter of knowledge but as the dawning or
      break of day. For at that time the world was altogether home-bred, every
      nation looked little beyond their own confines or territories, and the
      world had no through lights then, as it hath had since by commerce and
      navigation, whereby there could neither be that contribution of wits one
      to help another, nor that variety of particulars for the correcting of
      customary conceits.
    </p>
<p>
      And as there could be no great collection of wits of several parts or
      nations, so neither could there be any succession of wits of several
      times, whereby one might refine the other, in regard they had not history
      to any purpose. And the manner of their traditions was utterly unfit and
      unproper for amplification of knowledge. And again the studies of those
      times, you shall find, besides wars, incursions, and rapines, which were
      then almost every where betwixt states adjoining (the use of leagues and
      confederacies being not then known), were to populate by multitude of
      wives and generation, a thing at this day in the waster part of the
      West-Indies principally affected; and to build sometimes for habitation
      towns and cities, sometimes for fame and memory monuments, pyramids,
      colosses, and the like. And if there happened to rise up any more civil
      wits; then would he found and erect some new laws, customs, and usages,
      such as now of late years, when the world was revolute almost to the like
      rudeness and obscurity, we see both in our own nation and abroad many
      examples of, as well in a number of tenures reserved upon men's lands, as
      in divers customs of towns and manors, being the devices that such wits
      wrought upon in such times of deep ignorance, etc.
    </p>
<p>
      THE IMPEDIMENTS OF KNOWLEDGE FOR WANT OF A TRUE SUCCESSION OF WITS, AND
      THAT HITHERTO THE LENGTH OF ONE MAN'S LIFE HATH BEEN THE GREATEST MEASURE
      OF KNOWLEDGE, BEING THE 6TH CHAPTER, THE WHOLE CHAPTER.
    </p>
<p>
      In arts mechanical the first device comes shortest and time addeth and
      perfecteth. But in sciences of conceit the first author goeth furthest and
      time leeseth and corrupteth. Painting, artillery, sailing, and the like,
      grossly managed at first, by time accommodate and refined. The
      philosophies and sciences of Aristotle, Plato, Democritus, Hippocrates, of
      most vigour at first, by time degenerated and imbased. In the former many
      wits and industries contributed in one: In the latter many men's wits
      spent to deprave the wit of one.
    </p>
<p>
      The error is both in the deliverer and in the receiver. He that delivereth
      knowledge desireth to deliver it in such form as may be soonest believed,
      and not as may be easiliest examined. He that receiveth knowledge desireth
      rather present satisfaction than expectant search, and so rather not to
      doubt than not to err. Glory maketh the author not to lay open his
      weakness, and sloth maketh the disciple not to know his strength.
    </p>
<p>
      Then begin men to aspire to the second prizes; to be a profound
      interpreter and commenter, to be a sharp champion and defender, to be a
      methodical compounder and abridger. And this is the unfortunate succession
      of wits which the world hath yet had, whereby the patrimony of all
      knowledge goeth not on husbanded or improved, but wasted and decayed. For
      knowledge is like a water that will never arise again higher than the
      level from which it fell; and therefore to go beyond Aristotle by the
      light of Aristotle is to think that a borrowed light can increase the
      original light from whom it is taken. So then no true succession of wits
      having been in the world, either we must conclude that knowledge is but a
      task for one man's life, and then vain was the complaint that LIFE IS
      SHORT, AND ART IS LONG: or else, that the knowledge that now is, is but a
      shrub, and not that tree which is never dangerous, but where it is to the
      purpose of knowing Good and Evil; which desire ever riseth upon an
      appetite to elect and not to obey, and so containeth in it a manifest
      defection.

      CHAPTER 7. — THAT THE PRETENDED SUCCESSION OF WITS HATH BEEN EVIL
      PLACED, FOR ASMUCH AS AFTER VARIETY OF SECTS AND OPINIONS, THE MOST
      POPULAR AND NOT THE TRUEST PREVAILETH AND WEARETH OUT THE REST; BEING THE
      7TH CHAPTER; A FRAGMENT.
    </h2>
<p>
      It is sensible to think that when men enter first into search and inquiry,
      according to the several frames and compositions of their understanding
      they light upon different conceits, and so all opinions and doubts are
      beaten over, and then men having made a taste of all wax weary of variety,
      and so reject the worst and hold themselves to the best, either some one
      if it be eminent, or some two or three if they be in some equality, which
      afterwards are received and carried on, and the rest extinct.
    </p>
<p>
      But truth is contrary, and that time is like a river which carrieth down
      things which are light and blown up, and sinketh and drowneth that which
      is sad and weighty. For howsoever governments have several forms,
      sometimes one governing, sometimes few, sometimes the multitude; yet the
      state of knowledge is ever a DEMOCRATIE, and that prevaileth which is most
      agreeable to the senses and conceits of people. As for example there is no
      great doubt but he that did put the beginnings of things to be SOLID,
      VOID, AND MOTION TO THE CENTRE, was in better earnest than he that put
      MATTER, FORM, AND SHIFT; or he that put the MIND, MOTION, AND MATTER. For
      no man shall enter into inquisition of nature, but shall pass by that
      opinion of Democritus, whereas he shall never come near the other two
      opinions, but leave them aloof for the schools and table-talk. Yet those
      of Aristotle and Plato, because they be both agreeable to popular sense,
      and the one was uttered with subtilty and the spirit of contradiction, and
      the other with a stile of ornament and majesty, did hold out, and the
      other gave place, etc.

      CHAPTER 8. — OF THE IMPEDIMENTS OF KNOWLEDGE IN HANDLING IT BY
      PARTS, AND IN SLIPPING OFF PARTICULAR SCIENCES FROM THE ROOT AND STOCK OF
      UNIVERSAL KNOWLEDGE, BEING THE 8TH CHAPTER, THE WHOLE CHAPTER.
    </h2>
<p>
      Cicero, the orator, willing to magnify his own profession, and thereupon
      spending many words to maintain that eloquence was not a shop of good
      words and elegancies but a treasury and receipt of all knowledges, so far
      forth as may appertain to the handling and moving of the minds and
      affections of men by speech, maketh great complaint of the school of
      Socrates; that whereas before his time the same professors of wisdom in
      Greece did pretend to teach an universal SAPIENCE and knowledge both of
      matter and words, Socrates divorced them and withdrew philosophy and left
      rhetoric to itself, which by that destitution became but a barren and
      unnoble science. And in particular sciences we see that if men fall to
      subdivide their labours, as to be an oculist in physic, or to be perfect
      in some one title of the law, or the like, they may prove ready and
      subtile, but not deep or sufficient, no not in that subject which they do
      particularly attend, because of that consent which it hath with the rest.
      And it is a matter of common discourse of the chain of sciences how they
      are linked together, insomuch as the Grecians, who had terms at will, have
      fitted it of a name of CIRCLE LEARNING. Nevertheless I that hold it for a
      great impediment towards the advancement and further invention of
      knowledge, that particular arts and sciences have been disincorporated
      from general knowledge, do not understand one and the same thing which
      Cicero's discourse and the note and conceit of the Grecians in their word
      CIRCLE LEARNING do intend. For I mean not that use which one science hath
      of another for ornament or help in practice, as the orator hath of
      knowledge of affections for moving, or as military science may have use of
      geometry for fortifications; but I mean it directly of that use by way of
      supply of light and information which the particulars and instances of one
      science do yield and present for the framing or correcting of the axioms
      of another science in their very truth and notion. And therefore that
      example of OCULISTS and TITLE LAWYERS doth come nearer my conceit than the
      other two; for sciences distinguished have a dependence upon universal
      knowledge to be augmented and rectified by the superior light thereof, as
      well as the parts and members of a science have upon the MAXIMS of the
      same science, and the mutual light and consent which one part receiveth of
      another. And therefore the opinion of Copernicus in astronomy, which
      astronomy itself cannot correct because it is not repugnant to any of the
      appearances, yet natural philosophy doth correct. On the other side if
      some of the ancient philosophers had been perfect in the observations of
      astronomy, and had called them to counsel when they made their principles
      and first axioms, they would never have divided their philosophy as the
      Cosmographers do their descriptions by globes, making one philosophy for
      heaven and another for under heaven, as in effect they do.
    </p>
<p>
      So if the moral philosophers that have spent such an infinite quantity of
      debate touching Good and the highest good, had cast their eye abroad upon
      nature and beheld the appetite that is in all things to receive and to
      give; the one motion affecting preservation and the other multiplication;
      which appetites are most evidently seen in living creatures in the
      pleasure of nourishment and generation; and in man do make the aptest and
      most natural division of all his desires, being either of sense of
      pleasure or sense of power; and in the universal frame of the world are
      figured, the one in the beams of heaven which issue forth, and the other
      in the lap of the earth which takes in: and again if they had observed the
      motion of congruity or situation of the parts in respect of the whole,
      evident in so many particulars; and lastly if they had considered the
      motion (familiar in attraction of things) to approach to that which is
      higher in the same kind; when by these observations so easy and concurring
      in natural philosophy, they should have found out this quaternion of good,
      in enjoying or fruition, effecting or operation, consenting or proportion,
      and approach or assumption; they would have saved and abridged much of
      their long and wandering discourses of pleasure, virtue, duty, and
      religion. So likewise in this same logic and rhetoric, or arts of argument
      and grace of speech, if the great masters of them would but have gone a
      form lower, and looked but into the observations of Grammar concerning the
      kinds of words, their derivations, deflexions, and syntax; specially
      enriching the same with the helps of several languages, with their
      differing proprieties of words, phrases, and tropes; they might have found
      out more and better footsteps of common reason, help of disputation, and
      advantages of cavillation, than many of these which they have propounded.
      So again a man should be thought to dally, if he did note how the figures
      of rhetoric and music are many of them the same. The repetitions and
      traductions in speech and the reports and hauntings of sounds in music are
      the very same things. Plutarch hath almost made a book of the
      Lacedaemonian kind of jesting, which joined ever pleasure with distaste.
      SIR, (saith a man of art to Philip king of Macedon when he controlled him
      in his faculty,) GOD FORBID YOUR FORTUNE SHOULD BE SUCH AS TO KNOW THESE
      THINGS BETTER THAN I. In taxing his ignorance in his art he represented to
      him the perpetual greatness of his fortune, leaving him no vacant time for
      so mean a skill. Now in music it is one of the ordinariest flowers to fall
      from a discord or hard tune upon a sweet accord. The figure that Cicero
      and the rest commend as one of the best points of elegancy, which is the
      fine checking of expectation, is no less well known to the musicians when
      they have a special grace in flying the close or cadence. And these are no
      allusions but direct communities, the same delights of the mind being to
      be found not only in music, rhetoric, but in moral philosophy, policy, and
      other knowledges, and that obscure in the one, which is more apparent in
      the other, yea and that discovered in the one which is not found at all in
      the other, and so one science greatly aiding to the invention and
      augmentation of another. And therefore without this intercourse the axioms
      of sciences will fall out to be neither full nor true; but will be such
      opinions as Aristotle in some places doth wisely censure, when he saith
      THESE ARE THE OPINIONS OF PERSONS THAT HAVE RESPECT BUT TO A FEW THINGS.
      So then we see that this note leadeth us to an administration of knowledge
      in some such order and policy as the king of Spain in regard of his great
      dominions useth in state; who though he hath particular councils for
      several countries and affairs, yet hath one council of State or last
      resort, that receiveth the advertisements and certificates from all the
      rest. Hitherto of the diversion, succession, and conference of wits.

      CHAPTER 9. — THAT THE END AND SCOPE OF KNOWLEDGE HATH BEEN GENERALLY
      MISTAKEN, AND THAT MEN WERE NEVER WELL ADVISED WHAT IT WAS THEY SOUGHT;
      BEING THE 9TH CHAPTER, WHEREOF A FRAGMENT (WHICH IS THE END OF THE SAME
      CHAPTER) IS BEFORE.
    </h2>
<p>
      It appeareth then how rarely the wits and labours of men have been
      converted to the severe and original inquisition of knowledge; and in
      those who have pretended, what hurt hath been done by the affectation of
      professors and the distraction of such as were no professors; and how
      there was never in effect any conjunction or combination of wits in the
      first and inducing search, but that every man wrought apart, and would
      either have his own way or else would go no further than his guide, having
      in the one case the honour of a first, and in the other the ease of a
      second; and lastly how in the descent and continuance of wits and labours
      the succession hath been in the most popular and weak opinions, like unto
      the weakest natures which many times have most children, and in them also
      the condition of succession hath been rather to defend and to adorn than
      to add; and if to add, yet that addition to be rather a refining of a part
      than an increase of the whole. But the impediments of time and accidents,
      though they have wrought a general indisposition, yet are they not so
      peremptory and binding as the internal impediments and clouds in the mind
      and spirit of man, whereof it now followeth to speak.
    </p>
<p>
      The Scripture speaking of the worst sort of error saith, ERRARE FECIT COS
      IN INVIO ET NON IN VIA. For a man may wander in the way, by rounding up
      and down. But if men have failed in their very direction and address that
      error will never by good fortune correct itself. Now it hath fared with
      men in their contemplations as Seneca saith it fareth with them in their
      actions, DE PARTIBUS VITAE QUISQUE DELIBERAT, DE SUMMA NEMO. A course very
      ordinary with men who receive for the most part their final ends from the
      inclination of their nature, or from common example and opinion, never
      questioning or examining them, nor reducing them to any clear certainty;
      and use only to call themselves to account and deliberation touching the
      means and second ends, and thereby set themselves in the right way to the
      wrong place. So likewise upon the natural curiosity and desire to know,
      they have put themselves in way without foresight or consideration of
      their journey's end.
    </p>
<p>
      For I find that even those that have sought knowledge for itself, and not
      for benefit or ostentation or any practical enablement in the course of
      their life, have nevertheless propounded to themselves a wrong mark,
      namely satisfaction (which men call truth) and not operation. For as in
      the courts and services of princes and states it is a much easier matter
      to give satisfaction than to do the business; so in the inquiring of
      causes and reasons it is much easier to find out such causes as will
      satisfy the mind of man and quiet objections, than such causes as will
      direct him and give him light to new experiences and inventions. And this
      did Celsus note wisely and truly, how that the causes which are in use and
      whereof the knowledges now received do consist, were in time minors and
      subsequents to the knowledge of the particulars out of which they were
      induced and collected; and that it was not the light of those causes which
      discovered particulars, but only the particulars being first found, men
      did fall on glossing and discoursing of the causes; which is the reason
      why the learning that now is hath the curse of barrenness, and is
      courtesanlike, for pleasure, and not for fruit. Nay to compare it rightly,
      the strange fiction of the poets of the transformation of Scylla seemeth
      to be a lively emblem of this philosophy and knowledge; a fair woman
      upwards in the parts of show, but when you come to the parts of use and
      generation, Barking Monsters; for no better are the endless distorted
      questions, which ever have been, and of necessity must be, the end and
      womb of such knowledge.
    </p>
<p>
      But yet nevertheless here I may be mistaken, by reason of some which have
      much in their pen the referring sciences to action and the use of man,
      which mean quite another matter than I do. For they mean a contriving of
      directions and precepts for readiness of practice, which I discommend not,
      so it be not occasion that some quantity of the science be lost; for else
      it will be such a piece of husbandry as to put away a manor lying somewhat
      scattered, to buy in a close that lieth handsomely about a dwelling. But
      my intention contrariwise is to increase and multiply the revenues and
      possessions of man, and not to trim up only or order with conveniency the
      grounds whereof he is already stated. Wherefore the better to make myself
      understood that I mean nothing less than words, and directly to
      demonstrate the point which we are now upon, that is, what is the true
      end, scope, or office of knowledge, which I have set down to consist not
      in any plausible, delectable, reverend, or admired discourse, or any
      satisfactory arguments, but in effecting and working, and in discovery of
      particulars not revealed before for the better endowment and help of man's
      life; I have thought good to make as it were a Kalendar or Inventory of
      the wealth, furniture, or means of man according to his present estate, as
      far as it is known; which I do not to shew any universality of sense or
      knowledge, and much less to make a satire of reprehension in respect of
      wants and errors, but partly because cogitations new had need of some
      grossness and inculcation to make them perceived; and chiefly to the end
      that for the time to come (upon the account and state now made and cast
      up) it may appear what increase this new manner of use and administration
      of the stock (if it be once planted) shall bring with it hereafter; and
      for the time present (in case I should be prevented by death to propound
      and reveal this new light as I purpose) yet I may at the least give some
      awaking note both of the wants in man's present condition and the nature
      of the supplies to be wished; though for mine own part neither do I much
      build upon my present anticipations, neither do I think ourselves yet
      learned or wise enough to wish reasonably: for as it asks some knowledge
      to demand a question not impertinent, so it asketh some sense to make a
      wish not absurd.

<p>
      The plainest method and most directly pertinent to this intention, will be
      to make distribution of sciences, arts, inventions, works, and their
      portions, according to the use and tribute which they yield and render to
      the conditions of man's life, and under those several uses, being as
      several offices of provisions, to charge and tax what may be reasonably
      exacted or demanded; not guiding ourselves neither by the poverty of
      experiences and probations, nor according to the vanity of credulous
      imaginations; and then upon those charges and taxations to distinguish and
      present, as it were in several columns, what is extant and already found,

      whereby it will evidently appear that they are to be compassed and

      to check and control the vain and void assignations and gifts whereby
      certain ignorant, extravagant, and abusing wits have pretended to indue
      the state of man with wonders, differing as much from truth in nature as
      Caesar's Commentaries differeth from the acts of King Arthur or Huon of
      Bourdeaux in story. For it is true that Caesar did greater things than
      those idle wits had the audacity to feign their supposed worthies to have
      done; but he did them not in that monstrous and fabulous manner.

    </h2>
<p>
      It appeareth then what is now in proposition not by general circumlocution
      but by particular note. No former philosophy varied in terms or method; no
      new PLACET or speculation upon particulars already known; no referring to
      action by any manual of practice; but the revealing and discovering of new
      inventions and operations. This to be done without the errors and
      conjectures of art, or the length or difficulties of experience; the
      nature and kinds of which inventions have been described as they could be
      discovered; for your eye cannot pass one kenning without further sailing;
      only we have stood upon the best advantages of the notions received, as
      upon a mount, to shew the knowledges adjacent and confining. If therefore
      the true end of knowledge not propounded hath bred large error, the best
      and perfectest condition of the same end not perceived will cause some
      declination. For when the butt is set up men need not rove, but except the
      white be placed men cannot level. This perfection we mean not in the worth
      of the effect, but in the nature of the direction; for our purpose is not
      to stir up men's hopes, but to guide their travels. The fullness of
      direction to work and produce any effect consisteth in two conditions,
      certainty and liberty. Certainty is when the direction is not only true
      for the most part, but infallible. Liberty is when the direction is not
      restrained to some definite means, but comprehendeth all the means and
      ways possible; for the poet saith well SAPIENTIBUS UNDIQUE LATAE SUNT
      VIAE, and where there is the greatest plurality of change, there is the
      greatest singularity of choice. Besides as a conjectural direction maketh
      a casual effect, so a particular and restrained direction is no less
      casual than an uncertain. For those particular means whereunto it is tied
      may be out of your power or may be accompanied with an overvalue of
      prejudice; and so if for want of certainty in direction you are frustrated
      in success, for want of variety in direction you are stopped in attempt.
      If therefore your direction be certain, it must refer you and point you to
      somewhat which, if it be present, the effect you seek will of necessity
      follow, else may you perform and not obtain. If it be free, then must it
      refer you to somewhat which if it be absent the effect you seek will of
      necessity withdraw, else may you have power and not attempt. This notion
      Aristotle had in light, though not in use. For the two commended rules by
      him set down, whereby the axioms of sciences are precepted to be made
      convertible, and which the latter men have not without elegancy surnamed
      the one the rule of truth because it preventeth deceit, the other the rule
      of prudence because it freeth election, are the same thing in speculation
      and affirmation which we now observe. An example will make my meaning
      attained, and yet percase make it thought that they attained it not. Let
      the effect to be produced be Whiteness; let the first direction be that if
      air and water be intermingled or broken in small portions together,
      whiteness will ensue, as in snow, in the breaking of the waves of the sea
      and rivers, and the like. This direction is certain, but very particular
      and restrained, being tied but to air and water. Let the second direction
      be, that if air be mingled as before with any transparent body, such
      nevertheless as is uncoloured and more grossly transparent than air
      itself, that then etc. as glass or crystal, being beaten to fine powder,
      by the interposition of the air becometh white; the white of an egg being
      clear of itself, receiving air by agitation becometh white, receiving air
      by concoction becometh white; here you are freed from water, and advanced
      to a clear body, and still tied to air. Let the third direction exclude or
      remove the restraint of an uncoloured body, as in amber, sapphires, etc.
      which beaten to fine powder become white; in wine and beer, which brought
      to froth become white. Let the fourth direction exclude the restraint of a
      body more grossly transparent than air, as in flame, being a body
      compounded between air and a finer substance than air; which flame if it
      were not for the smoke, which is the third substance that incorporateth
      itself and dyeth the flame, would be more perfect white. In all these four
      directions air still beareth a part. Let the fifth direction then be, that
      if any bodies, both transparent but in an unequal degree, be mingled as
      before, whiteness will follow; as oil and water beaten to an ointment,
      though by settling the air which gathereth in the agitation be evaporate,
      yet remaineth white; and the powder of glass or crystal put into water,
      whereby the air giveth place, yet remaineth white, though not so perfect.
      Now are you freed from air, but still you are tied to transparent bodies.
      To ascend further by scale I do forbear, partly because it would draw on
      the example to an over-great length, but chiefly because it would open
      that which in this work I determine to reserve; for to pass through the
      whole history and observation of colours and objects visible were too long
      a digression; and our purpose is now to give an example of a free
      direction, thereby to distinguish and describe it; and not to set down a
      form of interpretation how to recover and attain it. But as we intend not
      now to reveal, so we are circumspect not to mislead; and therefore (this
      warning being given) returning to our purpose in hand, we admit the sixth
      direction to be, that all bodies or parts of bodies which are unequal
      equally, that is in a simple proportion, do represent whiteness; we will
      explain this, though we induce it not. It is then to be understood, that
      absolute equality produceth transparence, inequality in simple order or
      proportion produceth whiteness, inequality in compound or respective order
      or proportion produceth all other colours, and absolute or orderless
      inequality produceth blackness; which diversity, if so gross a
      demonstration be needful, may be signified by four tables; a blank, a
      chequer, a fret, and a medley; whereof the fret is evident to admit great
      variety. Out of this assertion are satisfied a multitude of effects and
      observations, as that whiteness and blackness are most incompatible with
      transparence; that whiteness keepeth light, and blackness stoppeth light,
      but neither passeth it; that whiteness or blackness are never produced in
      rainbows, diamonds, crystals, and the like; that white giveth no dye, and
      black hardly taketh dye; that whiteness seemeth to have an affinity with
      dryness, and blackness with moisture; that adustion causeth blackness, and
      calcination whiteness; that flowers are generally of fresh colours, and
      rarely black, etc. All which I do now mention confusedly by way of
      derivation and not by way of induction. This sixth direction, which I have
      thus explained, is of good and competent liberty for whiteness fixed and
      inherent, but not for whiteness fantastical or appearing, as shall be
      afterwards touched. But first do you need a reduction back to certainty or
      verity; for it is not all position or contexture of unequal bodies that
      will produce colour; for AQUA FORTIS, oil of VITRIOL, etc. more
      manifestly, and many other substances more obscurely, do consist of very
      unequal parts, which yet are transparent and clear. Therefore the
      reduction must be, that the bodies or parts of bodies so intermingled as
      before be of a certain grossness or magnitude; for the unequalities which
      move the sight must have a further dimension and quantity than those which
      operate many other effects. Some few grains of saffron will give a
      tincture to a tun of water; but so many grains of civet will give a
      perfume to a whole chamber of air. And therefore when Democritus (from
      whom Epicurus did borrow it) held that the position of the solid portions
      was the cause of colours, yet in the very truth of his assertion he should
      have added, that the portions are required to be of some magnitude. And
      this is one cause why colours have little inwardness and necessitude with
      the nature and proprieties of things, those things resembling in colour
      which otherwise differ most, as salt and sugar, and contrariwise differing
      in colour which otherwise resemble most, as the white and blue violets,
      and the several veins of one agate or marble, by reason that other virtues
      consist in more subtile proportions than colours do; and yet are there
      virtues and natures which require a grosser magnitude than colours, as
      well as scents and divers other require a more subtile; for as the portion
      of a body will give forth scent which is too small to be seen, so the
      portion of a body will shew colours which is too small to be endued with
      weight; and therefore one of the prophets with great elegancy describing
      how all creatures carry no proportion towards God the creator, saith, THAT
      ALL THE NATIONS IN RESPECT OF HIM ARE LIKE THE DUST UPON THE BALANCE,
      which is a thing appeareth but weigheth not. But to return, there resteth
      a further freeing of this sixth direction; for the clearness of a river or
      stream sheweth white at a distance, and crystalline glasses deliver the
      face or any other object falsified in whiteness, and long beholding the
      snow to a weak eye giveth an impression of azure rather than of whiteness.
      So as for whiteness in apparition only and representation by the
      qualifying of the light, altering the INTERMEDIUM, or affecting the eye
      itself, it reacheth not. But you must free your direction to the producing
      of such an incidence, impression, or operation, as may cause a precise and
      determinate passion of the eye; a matter which is much more easy to induce
      than that which we have passed through; but yet because it hath a full
      coherence both with that act of radiation (which hath hitherto been
      conceived and termed so unproperly and untruly by some an effluxion of
      spiritual species and by others an investing of the INTERMEDIUM with a
      motion which successively is conveyed to the eye) and with the act of
      sense, wherein I should likewise open that which I think good to withdraw,
      I will omit. Neither do I contend but that this motion which I call the
      freeing of a direction, in the received philosophies (as far as a swimming
      anticipation could take hold) might be perceived and discerned; being not
      much other matter than that which they did not only aim at in the two
      rules of AXIOMS before remembered, but more nearly also in that which they
      term the form or formal cause, or that which they call the true
      difference; both which nevertheless it seemeth they propound rather as
      impossibilities and wishes than as things within the compass of human
      comprehension. For Plato casteth his burden and saith THAT HE WILL REVERE
      HIM AS A GOD, THAT CAN TRULY DIVIDE AND DEFINE; which cannot be but by
      true forms and differences. Wherein I join hands with him, confessing as
      much as yet assuming to myself little; for if any man call by the strength
      of his ANTICIPATIONS find out forms, I will magnify him with the foremost.
      But as any of them would say that if divers things which many men know by
      instruction and observation another knew by revelation and without those
      means, they would take him for somewhat supernatural and divine; so I do
      acknowledge that if any man can by anticipations reach to that which a
      weak and inferior wit may attain to by interpretation, he cannot receive
      too high a title. Nay I for my part do indeed admire to see how far some
      of them have proceeded by their ANTICIPATIONS; but how? It is as I wonder
      at some blind men, to see what shift they make without their eye-sight;
      thinking with myself that if I were blind I could hardly do it. Again
      Aristotle's school confesseth that there is no true knowledge but by
      causes, no true cause but the form, no true form known except one, which
      they are pleased to allow; and therefore thus far their evidence standeth
      with us, that both hitherto there hath been nothing but a shadow of
      knowledge, and that we propound now that which is agreed to be worthiest
      to be sought, and hardest to be found. There wanteth now a part very
      necessary, not by way of supply but by way of caution; for as it is seen
      for the most part that the outward tokens and badges of excellency and
      perfection are more incident to things merely counterfeit than to that
      which is true, but for a meaner and baser sort; as a dubline is more like
      a perfect ruby than a spinel, and a counterfeit angel is made more like a
      true angel than if it were an angel coined of China gold; in like manner
      the direction carrieth a resemblance of a true direction in verity and
      liberty which indeed is no direction at all. For though your direction
      seem to be certain and free by pointing you to a nature that is
      unseparable from the nature you inquire upon, yet if it do not carry you
      on a degree or remove nearer to action, operation, or light to make or
      produce, it is but superficial and counterfeit. Wherefore to secure and
      warrant what is a true direction, though that general note I have given be
      perspicuous in itself (for a man shall soon cast with himself whether he
      be ever the nearer to effect and operate or no, or whether he have won but
      an abstract or varied notion) yet for better instruction I will deliver
      three particular notes of caution. The first is that the nature discovered
      be more original than the nature supposed, and not more secondary or of
      the like degree; as to make a stone bright or to make it smooth it is a
      good direction to say, make it even; but to make a stone even it is no
      good direction to say, make it bright or make it smooth; for the rule is
      that the disposition of any thing referring to the state of it in itself
      or the parts, is more original than that which is relative or transitive
      towards another thing. So evenness is the disposition of the stone in
      itself, but smooth is to the hand and bright to the eye, and yet
      nevertheless they all cluster and concur; and yet the direction is more
      unperfect, if it do appoint you to such a relative as is in the same kind
      and not in a diverse. For in the direction to produce brightness by
      smoothness, although properly it win no degree, and will never teach you
      any new particulars before unknown; yet by way of suggestion or bringing
      to mind it may draw your consideration to some particulars known but not
      remembered; as you shall sooner remember some practical means of making
      smoothness, than if you had fixed your consideration only upon brightness
      by making reflexion, as thus, make it such as you may see your face in it,
      this is merely secondary, and helpeth neither by way of informing nor by
      way of suggestion. So if in the inquiry of whiteness you were directed to
      make such a colour as should be seen furthest in a dark light; here you
      are advanced nothing at all. For these kinds of natures are but
      proprieties, effects, circumstances, concurrences, or what else you shall
      like to call them, and not radical and formative natures towards the
      nature supposed. The second caution is that the nature inquired be
      collected by division before composition, or to speak more properly, by
      composition subaltern before you ascend to composition absolute, etc.

      OF THE INTERNAL AND PROFOUND ERRORS AND SUPERSTITIONS IN THE NATURE OF THE
      MIND, AND OF THE FOUR SORTS OF IDOLS OR FICTIONS WHICH OFFER THEMSELVES TO
      THE UNDERSTANDING IN THE INQUISITION OF KNOWLEDGE; BEING THE 16TH CHAPTER,
      AND THIS A SMALL FRAGMENT THEREOF, BEING A PREFACE TO THE INWARD ELENCHES
      OF THE MIND.

      The opinion of Epicurus that the gods were of human shape, was rather
      justly derided than seriously confuted by the other sects, demanding
      whether every kind of sensible creatures did not think their own figure
      fairest, as the horse, the bull, and the like, which found no beauty but
      in their own forms, as in appetite of lust appeared. And the heresy of the
      Anthropomorphites was ever censured for a gross conceit bred in the
      obscure cells of solitary monks that never looked abroad. Again the fable
      so well known of QUIS PINXIT LEONEM, doth set forth well that there is an
      error of pride and partiality, as well as of custom and familiarity. The
      reflexion also from glasses so usually resembled to the imagery of the
      mind, every man knoweth to receive error and variety both in colour,
      magnitude, and shape, according to the quality of the glass. But yet no
      use hath been made of these and many the like observations, to move men to
      search out and upon search to give true cautions of the native and
      inherent errors in the mind of man which have coloured and corrupted all
      his notions and impressions.

<p>
      I do find therefore in this enchanted glass four Idols or false
      appearances of several and distinct sorts, every sort comprehending many
      subdivisions: the first sort, I call idols of the NATION or TRIBE; the
      second, idols of the PALACE; the third, idols of the CAVE; and the fourth,
      idols of the THEATRE, etc.

<p>
      That in deciding and determining of the truth of knowledge, men have put
      themselves upon trials not competent. That antiquity and authority; common
      and confessed notions; the natural and yielding consent of the mind; the
      harmony and coherence of a knowledge in itself; the establishing of
      principles with the touch and reduction of other propositions unto them;
      inductions without instances contradictory; and the report of the senses;
      are none of them absolute and infallible evidence of truth, and bring no
      security sufficient for effects and operations. That the discovery of new
      works and active directions not known before, is the only trial to be
      accepted of; and yet not that neither, in ease where one particular giveth
      light to another; but where particulars induce an axiom or observation,
      which axiom found out discovereth and designeth new particulars. That the
      nature of this trial is not only upon the point, whether the knowledge be
      profitable or no, but even upon the point whether the knowledge be true or
      no; not because you may always conclude that the Axiom which discovereth
      new instances is true, but contrariwise you may safely conclude that if it
      discover not any new instance it is in vain and untrue. That by new
      instances are not always to be understood new recipes but new
      assignations, and of the diversity between these two. That the subtilty of
      words, arguments, notions, yea of the senses themselves, is but rude and
      gross in comparison of the subtilty of things; and of the slothful and
      flattering opinions of those which pretend to honour the mind of man in
      withdrawing and abstracting it from particulars, and of the inducements
      and motives whereupon such opinions have been conceived and received.

      Of the error in propounding chiefly the search of causes and productions
      of things concrete, which are infinite and transitory, and not of abstract
      natures, which are few and permanent. That these natures are as the
      alphabet or simple letters, whereof the variety of things consisteth; or
      as the colours mingled in the painter's shell, wherewith he is able to
      make infinite variety of faces or shapes. An enumeration of them according
      to popular note. That at the first one would conceive that in the schools
      by natural philosophy were meant the knowledge of the efficients of things
      concrete; and by metaphysic the knowledge of the forms of natures simple;
      which is a good and fit division of knowledge: but upon examination there
      is no such matter by them intended. That the little inquiry into the
      production of simple natures sheweth well that works were not sought;
      because by the former knowledge some small and superficial deflexions from
      the ordinary generations and productions may be found out, but the
      discovery of all profound and radical alteration must arise out of the
      latter knowledge.

      Of the error in propounding the search of the materials or dead beginnings
      or principles of things, and not the nature of motions, inclinations, and
      applications. That the whole scope of the former search is impertinent and
      vain; both because there are no such beginnings, and if there were they
      could not be known. That the latter manner of search (which is all) they
      pass over compendiously and slightly as a by-matter. That the several
      conceits in that kind, as that the lively and moving beginnings of things
      should be shift or appetite of matter to privation; the spirit of the
      world working in matter according to platform; the proceeding or
      fructifying of distinct kinds according to their proprieties; the
      intercourse of the elements by mediation of their common qualities; the
      appetite of like portions to unite themselves; amity and discord, or
      sympathy and antipathy; motion to the centre, with motion of stripe or
      press; the casual agitation, aggregation, and essays of the solid portions
      in the void space; motion of shuttings and openings; are all mere
      nugations; and that the calculating and ordination of the true degrees,
      moments, limits, and laws of motions and alterations (by means whereof all
      works and effects are produced), is a matter of a far other nature than to
      consist in such easy and wild generalities.

      CHAPTER 15.
    </h2>
<p>
      Of the great error of inquiring knowledge in Anticipations. That I call
      Anticipations the voluntary collections that the mind maketh of knowledge;
      which is every man's reason. That though this be a solemn thing, and
      serves the turn to negotiate between man and man (because of the
      conformity and participation of men's minds in the like errors), yet
      towards inquiry of the truth of things and works it is of no value. That
      civil respects are a lett that this pretended reason should not be so
      contemptibly spoken of as were fit and medicinable, in regard that hath
      been too much exalted and glorified, to the infinite detriment of man's
      estate. Of the nature of words and their facility and aptness to cover and
      grace the defects of Anticipations. That it is no marvel if these
      Anticipations have brought forth such diversity and repugnance in
      opinions, theories, or philosophies, as so many fables of several
      arguments. That had not the nature of civil customs and government been in
      most times somewhat adverse to such innovations, though contemplative,
      there might have been and would have been many more. That the second
      school of the Academics and the sect of Pyrrho, or the considerers that
      denied comprehension, as to the disabling of man's knowledge (entertained
      in Anticipations) is well to be allowed, but that they ought when they had
      overthrown and purged the floor of the ruins to have sought to build
      better in place. And more especially that they did unjustly and
      prejudicially to charge the deceit upon the report of the senses, which
      admitteth very sparing remedy; being indeed to have been charged upon the
      Anticipations of the mind, which admitteth a perfect remedy. That the
      information of the senses is sufficient, not because they err not, but
      because the use of the sense in discovering of knowledge is for the most
      part not immediate. So that it is the work, effect, or instance, that
      trieth the Axiom, and the sense doth but try the work done or not done,
      being or not being. That the mind of man in collecting knowledge needeth
      great variety of helps, as well as the hand of man in manual and
      mechanical practices needeth great variety of instruments. And that it
      were a poor work that if instruments were removed men would overcome with
      their naked hands. And of the distinct points of want and insufficiency in
      the mind of man.

      to comprehend knowledge without helps and supplies, so again it is not

      errors and superstitions in the nature of the mind, and of the four sorts

      vanity and malignity of the affections, leave nothing but impotency and
      confusion. A recital of the particular kinds of these four Idols, with

      Of the errors of such as have descended and applied themselves to
      experience, and attempted to induce knowledge upon particulars. That they
      have not had the resolution and strength of mind to free themselves wholly
      from Anticipations, but have made a confusion and intermixture of
      Anticipations and observations, and so vanished. That if any have had the
      strength of mind generally to purge away and discharge all Anticipations,
      they have not had that greater and double strength and patience of mind,
      as well to repel new Anticipations after the view and search of
      particulars, as to reject old which were in their mind before; but have
      from particulars and history flown up to principles without the mean
      degrees, and so framed all the middle generalities or axioms, not by way
      of scale or ascension from particulars, but by way of derivation from
      principles; whence hath issued the infinite chaos of shadows and notions,
      wherewith both books and minds have been hitherto, and may be yet
      hereafter much more pestered. That in the course of those derivations, to
      make them yet the more unprofitable, they have used when any light of new
      instance opposite to any assertion appeared, rather to reconcile the
      instance than to amend the rule. That if any have had or shall have the
      power and resolution to fortify and inclose his mind against all
      Anticipations, yet if he have not been or shall not be cautioned by the
      full understanding of the nature of the mind and spirit of man, and
      therein of the seats, pores and passages both of knowledge and error, he
      hath not been nor shall not be possibly able to guide or keep on his
      course aright. That those that have been conversant in experience and
      observation have used, when they have intended to discover the cause of
      any effect, to fix their consideration narrowly and exactly upon that
      effect itself with all the circumstances thereof, and to vary the trial
      thereof as many ways as can be devised; which course amounteth but to a
      tedious curiosity, and ever breaketh off in wondering and not in knowing;
      and that they have not used to enlarge their observation to match and sort
      that effect with instances of a diverse subject, which must of necessity
      be before any cause be found out. That they have passed over the
      observation of instances vulgar and ignoble, and stayed their attention
      chiefly upon instances of mark; whereas the other sort are for the most
      part more significant and of better height and information. That every
      particular that worketh any effect is a thing compounded (more or less) of
      diverse single natures, (more manifest and more obscure,) and that it
      appeareth not to whether of the natures the effect is to be ascribed, and
      yet notwithstanding they have taken a course without breaking particulars
      and reducing them by exclusions and inclusions to a definite point, to
      conclude upon inductions in gross, which empirical course is no less vain
      than the scholastical. That all such as have sought action and work out of
      their inquiry have been hasty and pressing to discover some practices for
      present use, and not to discover Axioms, joining with them the new
      assignations as their sureties. That the forerunning of the mind to frame
      recipes upon Axioms at the entrance, is like Atalanta's golden ball that
      hindereth and interrupteth the course, and is to be inhibited till you
      have ascended to a certain stage and degree of generalities; which
      forbearance will be liberally recompensed in the end; and that chance
      discovereth new inventions by one and one, but science by knots and
      clusters. That they have not collected sufficient quantity of particulars,
      nor them in sufficient certainty and subtilty, nor of all several kinds,
      nor with those advantages and discretions in the entry and sorting which
      are requisite; and of the weak manner of collecting natural history which
      hath been used. Lastly that they had no knowledge of the formulary of
      interpretation, the work whereof is to abridge experience and to make
      things as certainly found out by Axiom in short time, as by infinite
      experiences in ages.

      CHAPTER 18.
    </h2>
<p>
      That the cautels and devices put in practice in the delivery of knowledge
      for the covering and palliating of ignorance, and the gracing and
      overvaluing of that they utter, are without number; but none more bold and
      more hurtful than two; the one that men have used of a few observations
      upon any subject to make a solemn and formal art, by filling it up with
      discourse, accommodating it with some circumstances and directions to
      practice, and digesting it into method, whereby men grow satisfied and
      secure, as if no more inquiry were to be made of that matter; the other,
      that men have used to discharge ignorance with credit, in defining all
      those effects which they cannot attain unto to be out of the compass of
      art and human endeavour. That the very styles and forms of utterance are
      so many characters of imposture, some choosing a style of pugnacity and
      contention, some of satire and reprehension, some of plausible and
      tempting similitudes and examples, some of great words and high discourse,
      some of short and dark sentences, some of exactness of method, all of
      positive affirmation, without disclosing the true motives and proofs of
      their opinions, or free confessing their ignorance or doubts, except it be
      now and then for a grace, and in cunning to win the more credit in the
      rest, and not in good faith. That although men be free from these errors
      and incumbrances in the will and affection, yet it is not a thing so easy
      as is conceived to convey the conceit of one man's mind into the mind of
      another without loss or mistaking, specially in notions new and differing
      from those that are received. That never any knowledge was delivered in
      the same order it was invented, no not in the mathematic, though it should
      seem otherwise in regard that the propositions placed last do use the propositions
      or grants placed first for their proof and demonstration. That there are
      forms and methods of tradition wholly distinct and differing, according to
      their ends whereto they are directed. That there are two ends of tradition
      of knowledge, the one to teach and instruct for use and practice, the
      other to impart or intimate for re-examination and progression. That the
      former of these ends requireth a method not the same whereby it was
      invented and induced, but such as is most compendious and ready whereby it
      may be used and applied. That the latter of the ends, which is where a
      knowledge is delivered to be continued and spun on by a succession of
      labours, requireth a method whereby it may be transposed to another in the
      same manner as it was collected, to the end it may be discerned both where
      the work is weak, and where it breaketh off. That this latter method is
      not only unfit for the former end, but also impossible for all knowledge
      gathered and insinuated by Anticipations, because the mind working
      inwardly of itself, no man can give a just account how he came to that
      knowledge which he hath received, and that therefore this method is
      peculiar for knowledge gathered by interpretation. That the discretion
      anciently observed, though by the precedent of many vain persons and
      deceivers disgraced, of publishing part, and reserving part to a private
      succession, and of publishing in a manner whereby it shall not be to the
      capacity nor taste of all, but shall as it were single and adopt his
      reader, is not to be laid aside, both for the avoiding of abuse in the
      excluded, and the stregthening of affection in the admitted. That there
      are other virtues of tradition, as that there be no occasion given to
      error, and that it carry a vigour to root and spread against the vanity of
      wits and injuries of time; all which if they were ever due to any
      knowledge delivered, or if they were never due to any human knowledge
      heretofore delivered, yet are now due to the knowledge propounded.

      CHAPTER 19.
    </h2>
<p>
      Of the impediments which have been in the affections, the principle
      whereof hath been despair or diffidence, and the strong apprehension of
      the difficulty, obscurity, and infiniteness which belongeth to the
      invention of knowledge, and that men have not known their own strength,
      and that the supposed difficulties and vastness of the work is rather in
      shew and muster than in state or substance where the true way is taken.
      That this diffidence hath moved and caused some never to enter into
      search, and others when they have been entered either to give over or to
      seek a more compendious course than can stand with the nature of true
      search. That of those that have refused and prejudged inquiry, the more
      sober and grave sort of wits have depended upon authors and traditions,
      and the more vain and credulous resorted to revelation and intelligence
      with spirits and higher natures. That of those that have entered into
      search, some having fallen upon some conceits which they after consider to
      be the same which they have found in former authors, have suddenly taken a
      persuasion that a man shall but with much labour incur and light upon the
      same inventions which he might with ease receive from others; and that it
      is but a vanity and self-pleasing of the wit to go about again, as one
      that would rather have a flower of his own gathering, than much better
      gathered to his hand. That the same humour of sloth and diffidence
      suggesteth that a man shall but revive some ancient opinion, which was
      long ago propounded, examined, and rejected. And that it is easy to err in
      conceit that a man's observation or notion is the same with a former
      opinion, both because new conceits must of necessity be uttered in old
      words, and because upon true and erroneous grounds men may meet in
      consequence or conclusion, as several lines or circles that cut in some
      one point. That the greatest part of those that have descended into search
      have chosen for the most artificial and compendious course to induce
      principles out of particulars, and to reduce all other propositions unto
      principles; and so instead of the nearest way, have been led to no way or
      a mere labyrinth. That the two contemplative ways have some resemblance
      with the old parable of the two moral ways, the one beginning with
      incertainty and difficulty, and ending in plainness and certainty, and the
      other beginning with shew of plainness and certainty, and ending in
      difficulty and incertainty. Of the great and manifest error and untrue
      conceit or estimation of the infiniteness of particulars, whereas indeed
      all prolixity is in discourse and derivations; and of the infinite and
      most laborious expense of wit that hath been employed upon toys and
      matters of no fruit or value. That although the period of one age cannot
      advance men to the furthest point of interpretation of nature, (except the
      work should be undertaken with greater helps than can be expected), yet it
      cannot fail in much less space of time to make return of many singular
      commodities towards the state and occasions of man's life. That there is
      less reason of distrust in the course of interpretation now propounded
      than in any knowledge formerly delivered, because this course doth in sort
      equal men's wits, and leaveth no great advantage or preeminence to the
      perfect and excellent motions of the spirit. That to draw a straight line
      or to make a circle perfect round by aim of hand only, there must be a
      great difference between an unsteady and unpractised hand and a steady and
      practised, but to do it by rule or compass it is much alike.

      Of the impediments which have been in the affection of pride, specially of
      one kind, which is the disdain of dwelling and being conversant much in
      experiences and particulars, specially such as are vulgar in occurrency,
      and base and ignoble in use. That besides certain higher mysteries of
      pride, generalities seem to have a dignity and solemnity, in that they do
      not put men in mind of their familiar actions, in that they have less
      affinity with arts mechanical and illiberal, in that they are not so
      subject to be controlled by persons of mean observation, in that they seem
      to teach men that they know not, and not to refer them to that they know.
      All which conditions directly feeding the humour of pride, particulars do
      want. That the majesty of generalities, and the divine nature of the mind
      in taking them (if they be truly collected, and be indeed the direct
      reflexions of things,) cannot be too much magnified. And that it is true
      that interpretation is the very natural and direct intention, action, and
      progression of the understanding delivered from impediments. And that all

      other superstitions and errors of religion. And that in the true religion
      there hath not nor is any impediment, except it be by accident or
      intermixture of humour. That a religion which consisteth in rites and
      forms of adoration, and not in confessions and beliefs, is adverse to
      knowledge; because men having liberty to inquire and discourse of Theology
      at pleasure, it cometh to pass that all inquisition of nature endeth and
      limiteth itself in such metaphysical or theological discourse; whereas if
      men's wits be shut out of that port, it turneth them again to discover,
      and so to seek reason of reason more deeply. And that such was the
      religion of the Heathen. That a religion that is jealous of the variety of
      learning, discourse, opinions, and sects, (as misdoubting it may shake the
      foundations,) or that cherisheth devotion upon simplicity and ignorance,
      as ascribing ordinary effects to the immediate working of God, is adverse
      to knowledge. That such is the religion of the Turk, and such hath been
      the abuse of Christian religion at some several times, and in some several
      factions. And of the singular advantage which the Christian religion hath
      towards the furtherance of true knowledge, in that it excludeth and
      interdicteth human reason, whether by interpretation or anticipation, from
      examining or discussing of the mysteries and principles of faith.

<p>
      Writing on the Back Cover of VALERIUS TERMINUS
    </p>
<p>
      The writing in the original is on the outside of the last leaf, which is
      in fact the cover. The front cover, if there ever was one, is lost. The
      ink with which the line containing the symbols is written corresponds with
      that in the body of the manuscript; and the line itself is placed
      symmetrically in the middle of the page, near the top. The two lower lines
      are apparently by another hand, probably of later date, certainly in ink
      of a different colour, and paler. The word "Philosophy" is in Bacon's own
      hand, written lightly in the upper corner at the left, and is no doubt
      merely a docket inserted afterwards when he was sorting his papers. What
      connexion there was between the note and the manuscript it is impossible
      to say. But it is evidently a careful memorandum of something, set down by
      somebody when the manuscript was at hand; and so many of the characters
      resemble those adopted to represent the planets and the signs of the
      zodiac, that one is led to suspect in it a note of the positions of the
      heavenly bodies at the time of some remarkable accident;—perhaps the
      plague, of which 30,578 persons died in London, during the year ending
      22nd December, 1603. The period of the commencement, the duration, or the
      cessation of such an epidemic might naturally be so noted.
    </p>
<p>
      Now three of the characters clearly represent respectively Mercury,
      Aquarius, and Sagittarius. The sign for Jupiter, as we find it in old
      books, is so like a 4, that the first figure of 45 may very well have been
      meant for it. The monogram at the beginning of the line bears a near
      resemblance to the sign of Capricorn in its most characteristic feature.
      And the mark over the sign of Aquarius appears to be an abbreviation of
      that which usually represents the Sun. (The blot between 1603 and B is
      nothing; being only meant to represent a figure 6 blotted out with the
      finger before the ink was dry.) Suspecting therefore that the writing
      contained a note of the positions of Mercury and Jupiter in the year 1603,
      I sent a copy to a scientific friend and asked him if from such data he
      could determine the month indicated. He found upon a rough calculation
      (taking account of mean motions only) that Jupiter did enter the sign of
      Sagittarius about the 10th of August, 1603, and continued there for about
      a twelvemonth; that the Sun entered Aquarius about the 12th or 13th of
      January, 1603-4; and that Mercury was about the 16th or 17th of the same
      month in the 26th or 27th degree of Capricorn: —coincidences which
      would have been almost conclusive as to the date indicated, if Capricorn
      had only stood where Aquarius does, and vice versa. But their position as
      they actually stood in the manuscript is a formidable, if not fatal,
      objection to the interpretation.
    </p>
<p>
      According to another opinion with which I have been favoured, the first
      monogram is a NOTA BENE; the next group may mean DIES MERCURII (Wednesday)
      26TH JANUARY, 1603; and the rest refers to something not connected with
      astronomy. But to this also there is a serious objection. The 26th of
      January, 1603-4, was a Friday, and it seems to me very improbable that any
      Englishman would have described the preceding January as belonging to the
      year 1603. Bacon himself invariably dated according to the civil year, and
      the occasional use of the historical year in loose memoranda would have
      involved all his dates in confusion. I should think it more probable that
      the writer (who may have been copying a kind of notation with which he was
      not familiar) miscopied the sign of Venus into that of Mercury; in which
      case it would mean Friday, 26th January, 1603-4. But even then the
      explanation would he unsatisfactory, as leaving so much unexplained. Those
      however who are familiar with old manuscripts relating to such subjects
      may probably be able to interpret the whole.

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div>

<div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

<div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

<div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>

<div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
